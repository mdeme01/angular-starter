# Angular starter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.

This is an Angular starter project, configured with TypeScript, ESLint and TailwindCSS, and an example service and routing.\
This project also contains a proxy to a custom backend.\
To use it for your projects, clone the repository for yourself, then initialize a new repository:

```bash
# Clone this repository, then remove git
git clone git@github.com:mdeme01/angular-starter.git <project-name>
cd <project-name>
rm -rf .git

# Create new repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository-name>.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
